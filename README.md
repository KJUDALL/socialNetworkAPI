# Social Network API

## Description
With how heavily Kanban boards are utilized across the development world, it's vital that users' data is kept secure. JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) help with this process. This project is meant to display my abilities in implementing such security and encode user's auth data. Without this feature, secure servers would not be able to fulfill and verify requests made on the users behalf. Although I didn't build out the direct code for this Kanban layout (starter code was provided) I most definitely implemented the JWTs and their functionality on the backend.

## Deployment Link

This app is being deployed publicly via Render. If you would like to simply view the functionality of the app without building it locally, you can do so at this link: https://kanbanboard-ondi.onrender.com.

## Installation

Users can clone this code repo using an IDE of choice. They must ensure bcrypt, dotenv, express, jsonwebtoken, pg, sequelize and npm are all installed. Because this code base uses TypeScript, be mindful of the npm scripts used to run and build this app. Npm install is needed, but it should be noted that npm run render-build will have additional functionality, aside from simply performing an npm install. Upon doing so, the user should be redirected to a live localhost deployment. This app will also be deployed on Render.

It should be noted that I was given starter code by means of the school. From there, I completed the noted "TODO" sections, and implemented the JWT functionality of this web dev.
